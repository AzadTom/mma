## 3. Other Crucial Factors (Aesthetics & UX)

1.  **Color Palette:** 
    *   *Primary:* Deep Black (`#121212`) or Charcoal.
    *   *Accent:* Aggressive/high-energy colors like Blood Red (`#D32F2F`), Neon Yellow, or Electric Blue.
    *   *Text:* Clean White or Light Gray for contrast.
2.  **Typography:**
    *   *Headings:* Bold, impactful, and condensed fonts (e.g., `Oswald`, `Teko`, or `Tungsten`).
    *   *Body:* Highly legible sans-serif for readability (e.g., `Inter`, `Roboto`, or `Open Sans`).
3.  **Imagery Style:**
    *   Images should NOT look like basic stock photos. They need to look raw, sweaty, and authentic. 
    *   Use high contrast, slightly desaturated backgrounds with the athletes highlighted.
4.  **Micro-Interactions & Animations:**
    *   Use smooth fade-ins and slide-ups as the user scrolls. 
    *   Hover effects on the program cards (e.g., image zooms in slightly, card glows with the accent color) to make the page feel alive.
5.  **Mobile Responsiveness:** 
    *   MMA demographics browse heavily on mobile. Ensure the Hero CTA is immediately visible on phone screens without scrolling, and that the schedules/tables stack cleanly so they are easy to read.
6.  **Page Speed:**
    *   Since you'll likely use high-quality videos/images, ensure all media is compressed (WebP format for images, lazy loading) so the site loads instantly.
